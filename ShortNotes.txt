SECTION 2 WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING

(A) Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

(1) On demand self service

(2) Broad Network access 

(3) Multi tenancy and resource pooling

(4) Rapid elasticity and scalability

(5) Measured service 



(B) SIX ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING

(1) Exchange Capital for operational performance

(2) Benifit from massive economies of scale
Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale

(3) Scale based on actual measured usage

(4) Increase speed and agility

(5) Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

(6) Go global in minutes leverage AWS global infrastructure



(C) Types of Cloud Computing

(1) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) manages Servers,Storage and Networking

(2) Platform as a Service manages (PaaS) manages Servers,Storage, Networking, Runtime, Middleware, O/S and Virtualization

(3) In Software as a Service, AWS takes care of everything



(D) AWS GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDES

--> AWS Regions
--> AWS Availability Zones
--> AWS Data Centers
--> AWS Edge Locations/ Points of Presence


(E) How to choose AWS Region

We Look at

--> Compliance with government regarding sending data outside the country

--> Proximity of the region with the customer

--> Availability services within region

--> Pricing


(F) Tour of the AWS Console

AWS has Global Services
--> Identity and Access Management (IAM)
--> Route 53 (DNS service)
--> CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
--> Web application Firewall (WAF)

Most AWS services are Region Scoped
--> Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as Service)
--> Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
--> Lambda (Function as a Service)
--> Rekognition (Software as a Service)


--> AWS is responsible for security of the AWS Cloud as well as capacity planning and maintenance of the AWS infrastructure. 

--> This includes physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, storage systems, and networking equipment.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 4 IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT (IAM)

--> You cannot use IAM to create local user accounts on any system. You are also not charged for what you use, IAM is free to use


(1) IAM ROLES FOR AWS SERVICES

--> We assign permissions to AWS Services with IAM Roles

--> IAM Permissions are included in a permission policy, which is then assigned to an IAM Role

--> Extra steps needed to configure IAM Roles

Common Roles are
---> EC2 Instance Roles
---> Lamda Function Roles
---> Roles for CloudFormation 


--> Groups only has users and not other groups


--> Access keys used to access AWS CLI/API

--> You cannot apply roles to groups, you apply policies to groups.

--> An IAM user name and password can be used for console access but cannot be used with the CLI or API

--> SSH public keys used for connections using the SSH protocol.


(2) IAM SECURITY TOOLS

IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
--> A report that lists all your accounts users and the status of their various credentials

IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
--> Shows service permission granted to a user and when a service was last accessed


(3) IAM BEST PRACTISES

---> Use Access keys for programmatic Access (cli/sdk)

--> IAM best practise is to not use the root user account

--> Another best practice is to grant least privilege access when configuring users and password policies.


--> An access key ID and secret access key are associated with an IAM user.

--> You cannot associate an access key ID and secret access key with an IAM Group, Role or Policy.



--> Customers are responsible for configuring their own IAM password policies and installing operating system patches on Amazon EC2 instances

--> AWS are responsible for installing patches on physical hardware devices, data center access controls and secure disposal of disk drives


--> You can manage AWS Identity and Access Management identities through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Tools, AWS SDKs, and IAM HTTPS API.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 5 EC2 ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD


(A) Basic Elastic Instance Types

(1) General Purpose : Balance between Compute, Memory, Networking

(2) Compute Optimized type :Great for compute intensive tasks that require high performance processors

(3) Memory Optimized Type : Fast Performance for workloads that process large data sets in Memory

(4) Storage Optimized Type :Great for storage intensive tasks



(B) EC2 INSTANCE Purchasing Options


(1) EC2 On Demand :Pay for what to use


(2) EC2 Reserved Instance: 

--> You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type,Region,Tenancy,OS)

--> This deployment option does not provide a specific physical server.



(3) EC2 SAVINGS Plans: Commit to a certain type of usage


(4) EC2 Spot Instances : Instances that you can "lose" at any point of time if your max
price is less than current spot price (Most cheapest)

--> Used for workloads resilient to failure

--> Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices, or Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.


(5) EC2 Dedicated Hosts :A physical server with EC2 instance dedicated to your use
(Most expensive option)

--> Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2, 
so that you get the flexibility and cost effectiveness of using your own licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity and elasticity of AWS


(6) Dedicated Instances: 

--> YOU HAVE YOUR OWN INSTANCE ON YOUR OWN HARDWARE

--> With dedicated instances you are not given a specific physical server to run your instances on.


(7) EC2 Capacity Reservations:

--> Reserve On demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

--> YOU CAN RESERVE EC2 INSTANCE FOR EITHER 1 YEAR OR 3 YEARS



(C) Convertible Reserved Instance

--> A convertible reserved instance enables you to exchange one or more Convertible Reserved Instances for another 
Convertible Reserved Instance with a different configuration, including instance family, operating system, and tenancy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 6 EC2 INSTANCE STORAGE

(A) WHATS AN EBS (Elastic Block Store) VOLUME ? 

--> ELASTIC BLOCK STORE (Volume) is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run

--> It allows your data to persist even after termination

--> They can only be mounted to one instance at a time and are bound to a specific availability zone


(B) EBS Snapshots 

--> Make a backup(snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time

--> Can copy snapshots across AZ or Regions

--> EBS Snapshot Archive
    --> Move Snapshot to an "archieve tier" that is 75% cheaper

--> EBS Snapshots stored in S3


(C) AMI OVERVIEW

--> AMI= AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE

--> AMI are customization of an EC2 instance


(D) EC2 IMAGE BUILDER 

--> USED TO AUTOMATE CREATION OF VIRTUAL MACHNES OR CONTAINER IMAGE


(E) ELASTIC FILE SYSTEM (EFS)

--> Manages NFS (Network File System) THAT can be mounted on 100s of EC2

--> It is built to scale on-demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, 
eliminating the need to provision and manage capacity to accommodate growth.

--> Used for storing data and is mounted by EC2 instances.


(F) EC2 INSTANCE STORE

--> For long term storage EBS IS GOOD

--> If you need high performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store

--> In exam if you see a high performance hardware attached volume for your EC2 Instances
think of EC2 Instance Store


(G) AMAZON FSX OVERVIEW

SECTION 7 ELB & ASG -ELASTIC LOAD BALANCE AND AUTO SCALING GROUPS


(1) HIGH AVAILABILITY

--> High availability means running your application in at least 2 
Availability Zones


(2) ELASTIC LOAD BALANCING OVERVIEW (ELB)

--> Distributes connections to EC2 instances

Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple 
servers downstreams

You can use Load Balancer to do regular health checks to your instances

WHY USE A LOAD BALANCER?
--> Spread load across multiple downstream instances
--> Expose a single point of access to your application
--> Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances


(3) Four Types of Elastic Load Balancers are 

(A) Application Load Balancer

--> For web applications with HTTP and HTTPS traffic

-->  It distributes traffic, does not scale resources.

--> Operates at request level

(B) Network Load Balancer

--> Provide ultra high performance

--> It distributes traffic, does not scale resources.

--> Operates at connection level

(C) Gateway Load Balancer

(D) Classic Load Balancer


(4) WHATS AN AUTO SCALING GROUP ?

--> An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances 

--> AWS Auto Scaling can help you optimize your utilization and cost efficiencies when consuming AWS services so you only pay for the resources you need.


(5) AUTO SCALING GROUPS (ASG) STRATERGIES

--> Manual Scaling : Update size of ASG manually

--> Dynamic Scaling Respond changing demand

DYNAMIC SCALING TYPES

(A) Simple\Step Scaling
When CloudWatch alarm is triggered (CPU > 70%) add 2 units
When CloudWatch alarm is triggered (CPU < 30%) remove 1 units

(B) Target Tracking Scaling 
Example : I want average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%

(C) Scheduled Scaling
Anticipate scaling based on known usage patterns
Example : increase the minimum capacity to 10 at 5pm on friday

(D) Predictive Scaling
Uses machine learning to predict future traffic ahead of time

--> You cannot Reserve S3 you pay for what to use.

S3 USE Cases
--> Backup and storage
--> Disaster Recovery
--> Archieve
--> Hybrid Cloud storage


(1) S3 Overview - BUCKETS

--> Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets"

--> S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region


(2) OBJECTS

(3) S3 SECURITY BUCKET POLICY

(A) User based
--> IAM policies- which API calls should be allowed for specific user from IAM
console

(B) Resource Based
--> Bucket Policies bucket wide rules from S3 console allows cross account

*Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
--> The user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
AND there is no explicit DENY

(C) ENCRYPTION

--> Encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys


(4) S3 STORAGE CLASSES 

(A) S3 Standard - General Purpose

--> Used for frequently accessed data

--> Used Cases: mobile gaming applications

--> S3 standard not available 53 minutes a year


(B) S3 Storage Classes - Infrequent Access

--> For data that is less frequently accessed but requires rapid access when needed
--> Lower cost than S3 Standard

(B1) Amazon S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
--> Use cases: Disaster Recovery, backups

(B2) Amazon S3 One Zone Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
--> High durability in a single AZ; data lost when AZ is destroyed

SECTION 9 DATABASES INTRODUCTION

--> Storing data on disk (EFS,EBS,EC2 Instance Store,S3) can have its limits


(1) RDS 

--> RDS stands for Relational Database Service

--> Its managed Database (DB) service for DB use SQL as a query language

--> The service is managed so this reduces the database administration tasks an administrator would normally undertake

--> You don’t manage the underlying operating system but still need to manage your own tables and data within the DB

--> RDS requires a well-defined schema.

--> Two of the benefits of using a managed Amazon RDS service are that you get automated backups and automatic software patching.

--> With RDS you cannot access the operating system so the requirement for running scripts on the OS rules RDS out. 

--> Therefore, the next best solution is to deploy on an Amazon EC2 instances 

--> Not auto scaling


Advantage over using RDS versus deploying Database on EC2

--> Scaling capacity (vertical and horizontal)
--> Monitoring dashboards
--> Multi Availability Zones for DR (Disaster Recovery)


(2) AMAZON AURORA

--> It works same way as RDS we have EC2 instance connecting directly into Amazon Aurora

--> Supports PostGreSQL and MySql 

--> Aurora is "AWS cloud optimized" and claims 5x performance improvement
over MySql on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS

--> Aurora requires a well-defined schema
